# CLAUDE.md — working notes for this repo

FB Group: a Singapore F&B CRM / QR-ordering / loyalty PoC. Project overview and the
capture-loop diagram live in `README.md`. This file is operating guidance for Claude.

## Stack
- **Backend** `apps/api` — FastAPI + SQLAlchemy 2.0 (typed `Mapped`/`mapped_column`) + Alembic.
  Own Python venv at `apps/api/.venv` (NOT in the JS workspace). PyJWT HS256, bcrypt direct.
- **Frontend** `apps/web` — Next.js 14 App Router, `(customer)` + `(merchant)` route groups,
  SVG charts, **no Tailwind**. Vitest for tests.
- **Shared** `packages/` — `api-client` (typed client, alias `@fbgroup/api-client`), `ui`, `types`, `config`.
- **DB** — Postgres 16 in Docker for prod-like; **SQLite for pytest** (in-memory, StaticPool,
  `Base.metadata.create_all` — tests do NOT run through Alembic). Same ORM code both ways.
- **Infra** `infra/docker-compose.yml`. **Git repo** (origin `github.com/MetaliveSG/FB-Group`); branch +
  PR flow per `CONTRIBUTING.md` (no direct commits to `main`, conventional commits, add a migration for
  schema changes). "Save progress" = commit on a feature branch (+ memory for context not in code).

## Run & test
```bash
# Backend (fastest, SQLite):
cd apps/api && .venv/bin/python -m app.seed && .venv/bin/uvicorn app.main:app
cd apps/api && .venv/bin/python -m pytest          # backend tests
# Re-seed the SG-local merchant against live Postgres (idempotent, safe, no data loss):
cd apps/api && .venv/bin/python -m app.seed_kampong
# Full stack (Postgres + API + web):
docker-compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up --build
# Frontend:
cd apps/web && npm install && npm run dev      # dev
cd apps/web && npm run test                    # Vitest
```
Baseline: **230 backend + 45 frontend tests pass** · ~120 endpoints · 42 tables · 17 migrations.

## Member tree (org spine) — Chain / Storefront
The org tree has **two node kinds** (engine keys off the `sells` flag; `role` is a display label):
**Chain** (structural — nests Chain/Storefront children; optional *stop-chain* → storefronts-only)
and **Storefront** (`sells=true` — the leaf that has the menu / takes orders). Boundary flags
(`is_settlement_boundary` + `is_loyalty_domain`) mark the **tenant** ("merchant"). Authority =
tree position × cascade; node-assignable role palette **Manager/Cashier/Staff/Finance**. Managed
from the **Platform Console** (`/platform`) directory drill-down: rows are clean (`badge · name ·
⋯`); the **⋯ opens a NodeDetailDrawer** (rename · status · subscription fee · stop-chain · add
child · node logins · enter). Endpoints: `GET /org/tree`, `POST/PATCH /org/nodes`,
`GET/POST/DELETE /org/nodes/{id}/accounts`. Proof: `artifacts/breadtalk-member-tree/`.
**As-built grounding — see `docs/architecture-org-tree.md §12`** (the authoritative as-built spec):
- **Provisioning** (`app/services/storefronts.py`): creating a Storefront (`POST /org/nodes` or a
  `member_kind=storefront` tenant) auto-mints its typed `Outlet` + **`Menu` with `id == node.id`** +
  `DiningTable` + stable `QRCode`. **`menu.id == node.id` is the invariant the resolvers key off.**
  Idempotent; `provision_missing()` backfills. Never run `sync_org_tree` on UI-built trees (re-parents).
- **QR resolution = 3 functions, 3 radii:** directory **"QR Menu"** link (`org.py::_qr_paths_for`,
  node-keyed — Storefront→`/t/{own outlet token}`, Chain→`/t/node/{id}` iff it has direct storefronts) ·
  **group browse** `/t/node/{id}` = `catalog.direct_storefronts` (**DIRECT** children + directly-leased,
  NOT nested-under-sub-chain) · **venue scan** `/t/{token}` = `catalog.list_outlet_stalls` (house ∪
  leased). `node_scope_stalls` (whole subtree) is for menu-reachability validation only.
- **Tables & QR** (`/merchant/tables`): per-table QR via `qrcode.react` (encodes `{origin}/t/{token}`) +
  Print/Print-all; add-table = fixed `T` prefix + number stepper (auto-next, padded `T01`…).
- **Enter scopes by the node** (`OperatorMerchant {id=tenant, nodeId, outletId?}`): Storefront → locked
  to 1 outlet; **any sub-chain → its subtree** (`menu-admin/outlets?node_id=`); tenant → all. Menu +
  Tables & QR sub-scope; **CRM/Orders/Settings stay tenant-wide** (loyalty ring = the tenant). Full nav
  shows in every mode; **Brands & Outlets are no longer a managed UI** (typed FK anchors only).

## Roadmap & next phases (priority) — see memory `roadmap-mvp-foundation`
**MVP (2 weeks) — mostly built.** The MVP merchant is **fully on our stack**: every sale goes through
**our** channels (table QR · our cashier POS · mobile/web app) → every sale is ours, already uniquely
id'd → **no "outside" sale, no external-reference/receipt-dedup in the MVP.** "POS link-up" = OUR
cashier POS (built: `create_manual_order`+`cashier_checkout`), NOT external-POS integration.
**Remaining work:** verify+harden the 3 channels record sale+rewards consistently · sales report · CRM ·
rewards (all built) · **PDPA consent at capture** (the one new add) · first-merchant go-live + demo polish.
*Optional foundation tidy:* extract a shared `record_sale()` core so the 3 channels converge and external
doors are a trivial add later — not a blocker. *Do NOT build:* external-POS ingestion/receipt-dedup
(keep-your-POS = P1), aggregator pull-in (P5), venue/lease/settlement/franchising/Storefront-re-key.
**Foundation Contract (7 guarantees, keep future phases additive — no restructure):** ① `org_nodes`
= canonical spine, typed tables = profiles+FK anchors (MVP keeps `Order.outlet_id`; future adds
`storefront_id` alongside) · ② stable IDs forever (`node.id==profile.id`) · ③ flag-based RBAC via the
spine · ④ money=Decimal, settlement/loyalty resolved on the node · ⑤ one QR/token→context resolver
(`qr.py`; outlet = a *location/venue*, menu = the *seller* — never bake "outlet == sellable unit") ·
⑥ one `record_sale()` core all channels funnel through (MVP = our QR/POS/app converge to it; external
doors — keep-your-POS/receipt/aggregator — are additive callers later, no new plumbing) · ⑦ everything behind capability flags.
**Moats** (see memory `moat-register`): **M1** data network · **M2** split settlement · **M3** member-tree
model (BUILT) · **M4** SEA operating-model/compliance · **M5** lock-in. Each phase is tagged with the
moat it builds — never ship a phase without knowing which defensibility it serves.
**MVP** → locks the Foundation Contract (*protects* M3) + seeds **M1** (capture identity) & **M5** (CRM/coin lock-in).
**Phases (priority):**
- P1 ★★★ **commission-escape** → **builds M1** [+M5] — node-addressable brand/group apps + takeaway/
  delivery + referral loop + finish PDPA. *The wedge: own your customer, escape ~30% aggregator fee.*
- P2 ★★★ **multi-party settlement + venue/lease** → **builds M2** [+M4] — foodcourt GTO vs coffeeshop
  fixed-rent; split settlement. *The crown-jewel moat.*
- P3 ★★ **franchising / value-rollup** → **builds M2·M5** [+M4] — royalty rollup + central menu; the Storefront re-key.
- P4 ★★ **AI ops** → **deepens M1** [+M4] — demand → labour + waste markdown (moat only via the cross-merchant data).
- P5 ★ **ops depth** → **builds M5** — KDS/inventory/aggregator pull-in (become the primary screen; selective).
Cross-cutting (NOT MVP): real providers (NETS/PayNow/Stripe, WhatsApp BSP) → **M4**+protect M1 trust;
scale stack (Redis/queues/websockets — arrive P2/4/5); staging+IaC+AWS. Compliance (PDPA/Nutri-Grade/
GST/CDC/MAS) → **M4** (the barrier to entry). GTM keep-your-POS → `gtm-pos-agnostic-capture` (feeds M1/M5).

## Environment gotchas (this machine)
- Docker CLI is **`docker-compose`** (hyphenated v1), NOT `docker compose` v2.
- Web is mapped to host **:3001** (host 3000 was taken); API on :8000; Postgres on :5432.
  API CORS allows both 3000 + 3001. API `DEBUG=true` in compose → OTP returns `debug_code`.
- DB creds (compose): user/pass/db all `fbgroup`. Connect tools to `localhost:5432`.

## Conventions & traps
- **Multi-tenant**: nearly every query is scoped by `merchant_id`. Lead with it in any composite index.
  Operator (super_admin) drills into merchants via `?merchant_id=`.
- **Money** = `Numeric(12,2)` as Python `Decimal`. **PKs** = `String(32)` hex UUID (`uuid4().hex`).
  **Timestamps** = naive UTC (`app/db/base.py::utcnow`); SG is UTC+8.
- **VARCHAR length**: SQLite tests do NOT enforce it; Postgres does. A value that fits in SQLite
  can 500 on Postgres (bit us once with a voucher code in `reward_redemptions.status`). Verify on PG.
- **Alembic migrations target Postgres natively** (plain `op.create_table`); they can't run on SQLite.
- **api-client types can claim fields the backend schema doesn't return** — TS compiles, runtime crashes,
  and only on the non-empty path. Keep `packages/api-client` types in sync with `app/schemas`.
- **Idempotent seed pattern**: `seed_kampong` / `_ensure_kampong_jackpot` do insert+update+remove keyed
  by stable name (with an empty-seed guard). "Edit the seed → re-run → live reflects it", no migration.
- **Provider mocks** (OTP / WhatsApp / AI insights): mock by default; real provider only when a flag +
  key are set (e.g. `AI_ENABLED=1` + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`). Tests/demo use the deterministic mock path.

## Where things are
- `apps/api/app/models/*.py` — schema (source of truth) · `app/services/` — business logic (ORM only, no raw SQL)
- `app/analytics/` — read-heavy paths (`reports.py`, `rfm.py`, `crm.py`) · `app/loyalty/engine.py` — hot accrual path
- `docs/` — `delivery-report.md` (canonical current state), architecture/api/database/security/testing/deployment/bc-dr/PRD
- `artifacts/` — generated proofs (openapi.json, pytest_results.txt, sample JSON, demo_credentials.md)
- `queries/` — ready-to-run diagnostic SQL (run via SQLTools or `psql -f`); see header in `01_customer_lookup.sql`
- `.vscode/` — SQLTools connection to the Docker Postgres + recommended extensions

## Demo credentials
- Operator: `http://localhost:3001/platform/login` → `superadmin@platform.sg` / `Password123!`
- Merchant owner: `http://localhost:3001/merchant/login` → `owner@makan.sg` (or `owner@kampongeats.sg`) / `Password123!`
- Customer QR: `http://localhost:3001/t/orchard-01` (or `kampong-bedok-01`); OTP phone `+6580000000` (DEBUG returns the code)
- QR tokens are **stable slugs** (per outlet+table) that survive reseeds.

## Memory & skills
- Persistent memory: `~/.claude/projects/-Volumes-Data-Drive-Coding-multi-agent-FB-Group/memory/`
  — `MEMORY.md` index + `build-state.md` (canonical Round log + KIVs), `project-fbgroup-crm.md`, `arch-decisions.md`, `user-prefs.md`.
  Run `/my-catchup` at session start; `/my-wrapup` to close out (updates memory + regenerates artifacts).
- Project skills in `.claude/skills/`: `/my-architect`, `/my-tester`, `/my-security-audit`, `/my-dba`,
  `/my-ops`, `/my-diagnose`, `/my-bizdev` (advisors) + `/my-catchup`, `/my-wrapup` (lifecycle).

## How the user works (Founder Mode)
~2-person team + Claude Code. Prioritize speed, working+tested software, revenue/adoption — while keeping
strong security/testing/architecture standards. Be decisive; prefer prose planning over multiple-choice
prompts. Don't claim completion without passing tests + proof of the demo flow.
